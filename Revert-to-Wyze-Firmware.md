Hi all,

We are working on solutions for firmware upgrade issues. One of the solution is to provide a way to revert back to older versions. Here is the instruction:

    Download a specific version of firmware, unzip it, put it on root directory of your SD card and rename it to FIRMWARE_660R_F.BIN
    Power off your camera, insert your SD card
    Hold the setup button, plug in your USB cable, keep holding the setup button for 12-15 seconds
    Release the button and wait for 3-4 minutes. The camera will reboot and change light status during this time.
    After it is done, the camera light should be flashing yellow (ready to setup)
    Re-setup your device as a new device

Note: I heard sometimes this method may not work on some SD cards. Please do reply this thread (with your SD card model, type, and size) if that happens to you. We have plan B if that happens but I am hoping this works for everyone.
